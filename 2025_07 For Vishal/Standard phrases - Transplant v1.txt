COMMENT

EM The electron microscopy component of this report is not currently UKAS accredited due to a change in equipment.

DP This case was reported using the Digital Pathology Whole Slide Acquisition. The laboratory is not UKAS accredited for this test.

NR There is no evidence of rejection.

SC? The cause for the scarring is not apparent.

NRNR There is no evidence of rejection or of recurrent disease.

CR? The cause for the recent rise in creatinine is not clear.

CRSUB? The cause for the suboptimal creatinine is not clear.

FSGS In the post-transplant setting, glomerular segmental sclerosis can be recurrence of primary FSGS or, more commonly, a glomerular pattern developed secondary to a number of glomerular insults. Careful clinic-pathological correlation is needed to distinguish these.

A history of (or evocative of) primary FSGS in the development of ESRF, early post-transplant development of new onset proteinuria, and extensive foot process effacement of epithelial cells would favour recurrent primary FSGS.

Late post-transplant development of new onset proteinuria, previous or concurrent significant glomerular or tubulointerstitial disease of a different nature (e.g. alloimmune), as well as segmental foot process effacement favour secondary adaptive FSGS.

Late post-transplant development of new onset proteinuria, previous or concurrent significant glomerular or tubulointerstitial disease of a different nature (e.g. alloimmune), as well as segmental foot process effacement favour secondary adaptive FSGS. This can be seen in association with reduction of functioning nephrons, increased haemodynamic stress on a normal nephron population, or in association with some infections (e.g. HIV) and drugs (including CNI and heroin use).

In this case, the features overall favour...

Mb This membranous glomerulonephritis could represent recurrent primary disease. However, de novo membranous has also been described in association with DSA and the usual causes, such as malignancies and infections.

ATI micro Tubular epithelial microvacuolation is not specific but has been described in acute CNI toxicity. Other associations include IVIG, plasma expanders and radiolabeled contrast media.

UTI In view of the neutrophilic tubulitis, please exclude a urinary tract infection.

i-IFTA There is marked inflammation in scarred areas of cortex, without other features of rejection. Please consider possible causes, such as chronic obstruction/pyelonephritis, poor perfusion or previous BK nephropathy or rejection (T cell or antibody-mediated). Please check for a DSA.

AH Possible causes for arteriolar hyalinosis include donor-derived hyalinosis , chronic CNI toxicity, diabetes or hypertension.

ABOi There is positive staining for C4d in peritubular capillaries, as is often observed in ABOi grafts.

C4d WER There is positive staining for C4d in peritubular capillaries in the absence of histological features of antibody-mediated rejection â€“ the significance of this finding is not known. Please correlate with serum DSA levels.

pAMR In the context of circulating DSA, individual lesions of MVI (g, ptc, v, acute TMA, cg, ptcml) below the histological threshold for MVI (g+ptc<2) and in the absence of C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries, probably indicate antibody activity. This phenotype can be diagnosed in patients with normal or abnormal kidney function. Depending on the clinical context, antibody-targeted treatment could be considered. Further research is necessary to determine the prevalence, impact, and best treatment for this phenotype.

MVI+ MVI above the histological threshold, without circulating DSA and with negative C4d staining in peritubular capillaries has been observed in patients with normal or abnormal kidney function. This is a purely descriptive phenotype, and the cause remains unclear. Further research is necessary to determine the prevalence, the causes and related biological processes and best treatment for this pattern. These cases may represent alloreactive T cell mediated responses; autoreactive or alloreactive non-HLA antibodies; primary NK cell activation through missing self; viral infection; other mechanisms of innate immune activation; ischemia reperfusion injury, etc.

TMA In view of the presence of TMA, in addition to AMR, other potential triggers (including transplant, infection, drugs, malignancy, paraprotein, pregnancy, etc) and underlying etiologies (genetic or metabolic) should be considered and standard nom
